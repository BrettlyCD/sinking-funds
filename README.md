# Sinking Funds Manager

## What are sinking funds?

When it comes to personal finances, sinking funds are used to save gradual amounts each month for a future expense. This could be an expense that occurs every year or every 6 months. It could even be a one-time large purchase you want to intentionally set aside month for.

## Why have a sinking funds program?

Setting aside money each month is easy enough with automatic savings transfers, or even with a pen and paper, if the scale is small enough. For me, I like to intentionally set aside savings for 5 or 6 periodic expenses. And I quickly found this to be really annoying. So annoying in fact, that I just stopped doing it. That's where this program comes in.

## How it works

This python application takes your inputs, prompting for necessary info and storing it in a json file. It then converts that json file into a pandas DataFrame to perform calculations and keep track of what you should be saving each month and when you should be disbursing those funds to use.
